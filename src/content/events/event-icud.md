<h2 class="subtitle" id="details">Roundtable details</h2>

The roundtable discussion, to be held in the context of the PM4U project, will delve into the intricacies of inclusive urban development in EU, Ukraine and other European post-war countries. The rationale behind the PM4U project is grounded in the urgent need for projects of urban transformation address a spectrum of issues related to post-war recovery, giving special attention to the integration of lessons learned from wartime experiences. The topics covered will extend beyond the immediate challenges of post-war recovery and encompass broader issues pertinent to all European cities, such as resilience, safety, security, energy transition, climate change, and inclusion.

The roundtable serves as a crucial platform for addressing both challenges and opportunities faced by the academic community and regional authorities in the context of urban recovery. It aligns with the broader goals of the Erasmus+ Jean Monnet Program's. Through this initiative, the project aims to contribute to the development of strategies and approaches that can guide urban transformation in post-war settings towards greater inclusivity and resilience.

The primary objective is to facilitate the exchange of lessons learned, knowledge, and best practices among European cities and cities that have undergone post-war recovery processes. This initiative aims to connect the experiences of war, recovery, and transformation, fostering more inclusive, cohesive, and resilient European cities and cities of post-war countries.
