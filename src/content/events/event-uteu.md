The online conference "Urban Transformation in the EU: Challenges and Opportunities" aims to bring together PhD students, early-career researchers, and academics from diverse fields to discuss the dynamic challenges and emerging opportunities in urban transformation within the European Union.

As cities evolve to address climate change, energy transition, digital transformation, and social inclusion, the role of innovative planning, interdisciplinary research, and cross-sector collaboration has become crucial.

Key themes include:

- Sustainable urban development and climate resilience.
- Energy-efficient and smart cities in the context of the Green Deal.
- Inclusive spatial planning for diverse communities.
- Digitalization and its impact on urban governance and infrastructure.
