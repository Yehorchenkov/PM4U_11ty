During the week of April 15th to 19th, 2024, a networking event was organized between the Institute of Management STUBA and several Ukrainian universities. These universities were represented by

- _Kyiv National University of Construction and Architecture_: (represented by Vice-Rector **Oleksandr Kovalchuk**, professors **Olena Verenych** and **Alina Zapryvoda**, and PhD students **Anton Sazonov** and **Ihor Vasyliev**),
- _Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv_ (with the presence of Head of the Department of Technology Management **Viktor Morozov** and Associate Professor **Andrii Khlevnyi**), and
- _National Transport University_ (led by Head of the Department of Ecology and Safety of Vital Functions **Viktoria Khrutba**).

The Ukrainian colleagues received a warm welcome from Professor **Maro≈° Finka**, the director of the Institute of Management, and researchers **Oleksii Yehorchenkov** and **Nataliia Yehorchenkova**. Discussions were held on common interests for future collaboration, not only in academic and research fields but also in creating a Central and Eastern European consortium that would be involved in post-war recovery efforts in Ukraine and support Ukraine's integration into the European Union. Additionally, several meetings were dedicated to the transfer of know-how and cooperation with Ukrainian energy companies.

The networking week concluded with a workshop titled **"Project Management in the Context of EU Urban Transformation: Smart Cities and Data-Driven Society."** During this event, questions were raised about the application of project management methodologies, approaches, and tools in the context of urban transformation.

The week's activities were co-funded by the European Union through the Erasmus+ Jean Monnet Programme PM4U (101126659), Erasmus ICM, and the EU NextGenerationEU through the Recovery and Resilience Plan for Slovakia under projects No. 09I03-03-V01-00024 and No. 09I03-03-V01-00025.
