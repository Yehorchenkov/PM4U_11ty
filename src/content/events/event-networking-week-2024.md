During the week of April 15th to 19th, 2024, a networking event was organized between the Institute of Management STUBA and several Ukrainian universities. These universities were represented by Kyiv National University of Construction and Architecture (represented by Vice-Rector Oleksandr Kovalchuk, professors Olena Verenych and Alina Zapryvoda, and PhD students Anton Sazonov and Ihor Vasyliev), Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv (with the presence of Head of the Department of Technology Management Viktor Motozov and Associate Professor Andrii Khlevnyi), and National Transport University (led by Head of the Department of Ecology and Safety of Vital Functions Viktoria Khrutba). The Ukrainian colleagues received a warm welcome from Professor Maro≈° Finka, the director of the institute, and researchers Oleksii Yehorchenkov and Nataliia Yehorchenkova. Discussions were held on common interests for future collaboration, not only in academic and research fields but also in creating a Central and Eastern European consortium that would be involved in post-war recovery efforts in Ukraine and support Ukraine's integration into the European Union. Additionally, several meetings were dedicated to the transfer of know-how and cooperation with Ukrainian energy companies.

The networking week concluded with a workshop titled "Project Management in the Context of EU Urban Transformation: Smart Cities and Data-Driven Society." During this event, questions were raised about the application of project management methodologies, approaches, and tools in the context of urban transformation.

The week's activities were co-funded by the European Union through the Erasmus+ Jean Monnet Programme PM4U (101126659), Erasmus ICM, and the EU NextGenerationEU through the Recovery and Resilience Plan for Slovakia under projects No. 09I03-03-V01-00024 and No. 09I03-03-V01-00025.
